# Introduction

An open-source UI component library for building modern web applications. Designed and powered by [Pingback](https://pingback.com/).

## Vision

Our vision for this open-source UI component library is three-fold:

1. **Simplicity & Adaptability**: Seamlessly merge the capabilities of React, TailwindCSS, RadixUI, and shadcn/ui, allowing developers to effortlessly craft modern web applications that are both beautiful and functional.

2. **Community-Centric Development**: We believe in the power of collective growth. This library isn't just ours - it's everyone's. We encourage contributions, feedback, and active participation from the global developer community to ensure this library remains relevant, updated, and user-friendly.

3. **Elevate Web Experiences**: As web technologies continue to advance, so should our tools. This library stands as a testament to our commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web design and development. We aim to empower every developer with tools that can transform visions into vibrant digital realities.

Join us in this journey as we shape the future of web applications, one component at a time.

## Inspiration

At the heart of every groundbreaking project is a source of inspiration, and for us at Pingback, that inspiration is drawn from the vast community of creators out there. We've always been motivated by those who push boundaries, those who refuse to settle for the ordinary, and those who strive relentlessly to craft something of impeccable quality.

In this quest for excellence, we've been fortunate to come across and leverage incredible tools like RadixUI and shadcn/ui. These projects, driven by their own set of passionate developers, have laid down the foundation for many to build upon. Their dedication to quality, innovation, and usability has not only inspired our work but has also been integral in shaping our library.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the teams behind RadixUI and shadcn/ui. Your endeavors remind us every day of the power of community, collaboration, and the endless possibilities that arise when creators come together with a shared vision.

To all aspiring creators out there â€” keep dreaming, keep building, and know that your passion is the true catalyst for innovation.
