# Getting Started

Welcome to the starting point of your journey with the Pingback UI component library! Before diving in, ensure that your project is using TailwindCSS, as it's a prerequisite for our library. Follow the steps below to integrate the Pingback UI library into your application seamlessly.

### Installation

1. **Install the Library**:  
    Using npm or yarn, add the `@getpingback/ui` package to your project:

   ```bash
   npm install @getpingback/ui
   ```

   Or, if you're using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn add @getpingback/ui
   ```

<br />

2. **Tailwind Configuration**:
   Update your tailwind.config.js to import the configuration from our library:

   ```javascript
   const pingbackConfig = require("@getpingback/ui/dist/tailwind.config");

   module.exports = {
     ...pingbackConfig,
     // ... Your custom configurations here (if any)
   };
   ```

<br />
3. **Import Global Styles**: To ensure consistent styling, import our global stylesheet
at the root of your application:

    ```javascript
    import "@getpingback/ui/dist/globals.css";
    ```

<br />
## Using the Components

Now that you've set everything up, you're ready to start using our components! Let's begin with an example of how to use the Badge component:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Badge } from "@getpingback/ui";

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div className='p-4'>
      <h1>Welcome to Pingback UI!</h1>
      <Badge>New</Badge>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

In the above example, we've imported and used the Badge component with a "primary" variant. You can explore our documentation further to discover the different variants and properties available.
